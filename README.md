# Description
This repository covers the **Capstone Project** (Spark Project 'Sparkify') of the Udacity Nanodegree Course _Data Science_.

## Blog Post
The Capstone Project is documented in this Medium Blog Post: https://medium.com/@t.mw/predicting-churn-with-apache-spark-and-pyspark-ml-429c3ad79670

## Installation
Nothing to install, just run the Jupyter Notebook **Sparkify.ipynb**.

## Libraries
The notebook imports and uses following libriaries:
* numpy
* pandas
* pyspark.sql
* pyspark.ml
* scipy.stats
* matplotlib.pyplot

## Data
The Notebook uses the mini data set 'mini_sparkify_event_data.json' (size 128 MB) that comes with the Udacity workspace. The data is not contained in this repository, it is expected to be in the same folder as the notebook.

## Project Motivation
The Spark Project was chosen as Capstone Project, because it's an opportunity to get to know Apache Spark and Big Data Machine Learning Methods that have not been coverd by the course so far.
